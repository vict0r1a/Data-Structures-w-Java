# Data-Structures-w-Java
Data Structures with Java, Project - Athes University of Economics and Business.
This is a three-part project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST PART: We're given the two interfaces StringStack and IntQueue 
with the basic methods used in a stack and a FIFO queue. We were called
to create Java classes which implement the two interafaces given.

SECOND PART: We created a class TagMatching.java using the stack we created in 
the first part to read an HTML file and checks if the tags match. A tag matches 
when there's an opening tag e.g <body> and the closing tag </body>. 

THIRD PART: We created a class NetBenefit.java using the queue we created in 
the first part to read a txt file. The code will return the benefit or the damage
that there is after the last sell. Note: the txt file must start with at least one buy
transaction and end with a sell one. 

Finally we were given some command line arguments instructions to run the code.
